What I changed

Enabled assets in pubspec.yaml so Image.asset('assets/images/lauchIcon.png') will load.
Added Otp Cubit and State:
lib/presentation/cubit/auth/otp_state.dart
lib/presentation/cubit/auth/otp_cubit.dart — manages countdown, resend and verify (mock).
Reworked OTP bottom sheet UI in login_page.dart to:
Title: "Xác thực OTP"
Instruction text: "OTP đã được gửi đến số điện thoại..."
6 digit inputs (auto-move focus, auto-submit when full)
Countdown resend (60s) with "Gửi lại mã" link
Button "Xác nhận"
On full input or press "Xác nhận": call OtpCubit.verifyOtp(); on success navigate to /dashboard, on failure show SnackBar.
Show snackbar on login failure (from LoginCubit failure state).
Ensured context usage after async is safe (captured Navigator before awaits).
Ran flutter analyze — only informational hints remain (use const where possible).
Why this fixes the logo not loading

pubspec.yaml now declares assets/images/ so Flutter will include assets/images/lauchIcon.png in the asset bundle and Image.asset(...) should load correctly at runtime.
Notes & next steps

OTP logic is mock: OtpCubit.verifyOtp treats 123456 as valid. Replace with API call for real verification.
Countdown is implemented and displayed; the resend button becomes active when countdown hits 0 and triggers otpCubit.resend().
I added SnackBar display for login failure states.
Two analyzer info messages remain about adding const in a couple of widget constructors — purely performance hints. I can address them (small edits) if you want.
Files touched (summary)

Edited: pubspec.yaml (added assets)
Added: lib/presentation/cubit/auth/otp_state.dart
Added: lib/presentation/cubit/auth/otp_cubit.dart
Edited: login_page.dart (integrated OtpCubit and reworked OTP bottom sheet)
What I can do next (pick one)
A) Polish UI: add const to remove analyzer infos and fine-tune styles.
B) Replace mock OTP/login behavior with real API calls (you provide endpoint/contract).
C) Add unit tests for LoginCubit and OtpCubit.
D) Commit changes and open a PR.



cd /workspaces/digital_bank_container/digital_bank_app && flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos
Done — I added the missing consts and removed the analyzer infos.

What I changed

Edited login_page.dart:
Marked the bottom navigation Row as const and added an explicit typed const children list:
from non-const Row with individual const children
to: const Row(... children: <Widget>[ _BottomNavItem(...), ... ])
This satisfies both:
prefer_const_constructors
prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables
Verification

Ran flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos in digital_bank_app — result: No issues found.
Notes

This change is purely performance/style; it doesn't change runtime behavior.
If you'd like, I can:
Apply similar micro-optimizations elsewhere (add const where applicable across the codebase).
Tweak visuals (colors, paddings, fonts) for the login screen to match the attached design screenshot.
Proceed with next tasks on your list (A: OTP resend/countdown polish is already implemented; B: error Snackbar was added).
