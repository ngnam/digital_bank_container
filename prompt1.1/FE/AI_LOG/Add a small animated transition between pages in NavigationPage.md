Done — I added a small animated transition between pages.

What I changed

Wrapped the page area in NavigationPage with an AnimatedSwitcher (300ms) using a Fade + Slide transition.
Keyed each page by ValueKey<int>(state.index) so switching the navigation index triggers the animation.
Used SizedBox.expand(child: pages[state.index]) inside the keyed subtree to maintain full-screen layout during transitions.
Why this helps

Switching tabs now cross-fades and slightly slides the incoming page up for a smooth, lightweight transition that feels responsive but stays performant on most devices.
Notes & testing

Animation duration and curves are modest; adjust Duration or Tween<Offset> if you want a faster/slower or larger/smaller slide.
I ran a quick error check on navigation_page.dart — no errors found.
To validate visually, run the app and navigate between tabs (tap nav items and FAB). If you'd like, I can run the app build here and capture a short GIF/screencast showing the animation.

If you'd like any of these follow-ups, say which one:

Change the animation (e.g., horizontal slide, scale, or different easing).
Animate the BottomAppBar / FAB in sync with page transitions.
Reduce rebuilds by extracting each page into its own widget file for performance.
